"""Utilities for calculating fetch tiers based on game timing.

This module provides reusable functions for determining fetch tiers (opening, early,
sharp, pregame, closing) based on how much time remains until a game starts. These
functions are used by both the live data collection pipeline and historical backfill
operations to ensure consistent tier classification across all data.

def calculate_tier(hours_until: float) -> FetchTier:
    """
    Determine fetch tier based on hours until game commence time.

    The fetch tier determines how frequently odds should be collected:
    - CLOSING (0-3 hours): Most critical period, fetch every 30 minutes
    - PREGAME (3-12 hours): Active betting period, fetch every 3 hours
    - SHARP (12-24 hours): Professional betting period, fetch every 12 hours
    - EARLY (1-3 days): Opening line establishment, fetch every 24 hours
    - OPENING (3+ days): Initial line release, fetch every 48 hours

    Args:
        hours_until: Hours until game commence time. Can be negative for
                    games that have already started.

    Returns:
        Appropriate FetchTier for the given time window.

    Example:
        >>> calculate_tier(1.5)  # 1.5 hours before game
        <FetchTier.CLOSING: 'closing'>

        >>> calculate_tier(48.0)  # 2 days before game
        <FetchTier.EARLY: 'early'>

        >>> calculate_tier(100.0)  # >3 days before game
        <FetchTier.OPENING: 'opening'>

def calculate_tier_from_timestamps(snapshot_time: datetime, commence_time: datetime) -> FetchTier:
    """
    Calculate fetch tier from snapshot and game commence timestamps.

    This is a convenience function that computes hours until game start and
    determines the appropriate tier. Useful for historical data where you have
    timestamps but need to determine the tier.

    Args:
        snapshot_time: When the odds snapshot was captured (timezone-aware)
        commence_time: When the game starts (timezone-aware)

    Returns:
        Appropriate FetchTier for the snapshot timing.

    Example:
        >>> from datetime import datetime, timedelta, UTC
        >>> game_time = datetime.now(UTC) + timedelta(hours=6)
        >>> snapshot_time = datetime.now(UTC)
        >>> calculate_tier_from_timestamps(snapshot_time, game_time)
        <FetchTier.PREGAME: 'pregame'>

    Note:
        Both timestamps should be timezone-aware. If they're not in the same
        timezone, the calculation will still be correct as Python handles
        timezone conversion automatically.
