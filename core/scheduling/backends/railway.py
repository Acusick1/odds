class RailwayBackend(SchedulerBackend):
    """
    Railway cron implementation.

    Railway uses static cron schedules configured via railway.json or UI.
    This backend is mainly for compatibility - scheduling operations are no-ops
    since Railway doesn't support dynamic schedule modification.

    Jobs will still execute self-gating logic to skip execution when appropriate,
    but they cannot dynamically adjust the cron schedule itself.

    Configuration:
    Configure static cron schedules in railway.json:
    {
      "cron": {
        "jobs": [
          {
            "name": "fetch-odds",
            "schedule": "*/30 * * * *",
            "command": "python jobs/fetch_odds.py"
          }
        ]
      }
    }

    Features:
    - Static cron schedules via Railway config
    - Smart gating logic in jobs prevents wasteful execution
    - Health checks verify configuration
    - Dry-run mode supported
