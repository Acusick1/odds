"""
Read-only CLI tests - validates CLI commands work with migrated database.

These tests run actual CLI commands using Typer's CliRunner to ensure:
1. CLI commands execute successfully against the migrated database
2. Database query operations work through the full application stack
3. Output is valid and contains expected information

IMPORTANT: These tests are READ-ONLY and safe to run on production.
They do NOT write to the database or use API quota.
