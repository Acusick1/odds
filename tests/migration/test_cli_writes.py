Write CLI tests - validates CLI write commands work with migrated database.

These tests run CLI commands that WRITE to the database and use API quota.

IMPORTANT: These tests are for DEV/LOCAL environments only.
- Uses API quota (~10-15 requests per test)
- Writes data to database
- Should NOT be run on production

The main migration validation is handled by test_schema_validation.py.
