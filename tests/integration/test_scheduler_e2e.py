"""
End-to-end test for the scheduler system.

This test suite provides TWO complementary E2E tests:

1. **test_scheduler_end_to_end**: Tests the complete production flow including
   APScheduler executing jobs (using real-time scheduling, no time mocking)

2. **test_job_self_scheduling_chain**: Tests the critical self-scheduling loop
   (Job → SchedulingIntelligence → Backend) with time mocking for all tiers

Together these provide confidence the scheduler will work in production.
